iterative grammarbased framework discover variablelength time series motif grammartime series analysisapproximation algorithmsnoise reductioncompression algorithmsalgorithm design analysisdata mining recent year find repetitive similar pattern time series become popular problem these pattern call time series motif recent study show that use grammar compression algorithm find repeat pattern from symbolized time series hold promise discover approximate motif with variable length however grammar compression algorithm traditionally design string compression therefore exist work grammar induction not fully utilized much available information that use enhance performance algorithm this work an iterative framework base grammar induction propose each iteration revision operator call noise reduction operator apply revise symbolized time series string base rule return from base grammar induction algorithm our experiment show that propose work find motifs same quality with much faster run time compare stateoftheart variablelength exact motif discovery algorithm real world time series data
