sparse temporal difference learn via alternate direction method multiplier approximation algorithmscontextoptimizationfunction approximationlearning artificial intelligenceprediction algorithmslinear program recent work offline reinforcement learn focused efficient algorithm incorporate feature selection via into bellman operator fixedpoint estimator these development now mean that overfitting avoid when number sample small compare number feature however it remain unclear whether exist algorithms ability offer good approximation task policy evaluation improvement this paper propose new algorithm approximate fixedpoint base alternate direction method multiplier admm demonstrate with experimental result that propose algorithm more stable policy iteration compare prior work furthermore also derive theoretical result that state propose algorithm obtains solution which satisfy optimality condition fixedpoint problem
