measure modelling delay robot manipulator temporally precise control use machine learn robot controlautomationmachine learn algorithms latency delay play an important role temporally precise robot control during dynamic task particular robot account inherent delay reach manipulate object time different type occur delay typically convolute thereby hard measure separate this paper present datadriven methodology separate model inherent delay during robot control show how both actuation response delay model use modern machine learn method result model use predict delay well uncertainty prediction experiment two widely use robot platform show significant actuation response delay standard control loop predictive model therefore use reason about expect delay improve temporal accuracy during control approach easily use different robot platform
