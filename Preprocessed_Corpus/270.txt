learn fairness under constraint decentralize resource allocation game resource managementgameslearning artificial intelligencecomputer sciencerobot sense systemselectrical engineering study multitype resource allocation multiagent system where some constraint enforce upon resource provider user these constraint limitation resource type connection availability which may make collaboration between agent infeasible discuss notion distribute resource fairness under these constraint then propose game theory reinforcement learn base solution collaborative resource allocation so that resource assign user fairly task assign resource agent efficiently utilize data from google data center our input simulation result show that our learn approach outperforms greedy random exploration term resource utilization fairness
