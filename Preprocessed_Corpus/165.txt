classification occlude object use fast recurrent processing recurrent processingocclusionneural network recurrent neural network powerful tool handle incomplete data problem computer vision thanks their significant generative capability however computational demand these algorithm too high work real time without specialized hardware or software solution this paper propose framework augment recurrent processing capability into feedforward network without sacrifice much from computational efficiency assume mixture model generate sample last hidden layer accord class decision output layer modify hidden layer activity use sample propagate low layer visual occlusion problem iterative procedure emulate feedforwardfeedback loop fillingin miss hidden layer activity with meaningful representation propose algorithm test widely use dataset show achieve improvement classification accuracy occlude object when compare restrict boltzmann machine our algorithm show superior performance occlude object classification
