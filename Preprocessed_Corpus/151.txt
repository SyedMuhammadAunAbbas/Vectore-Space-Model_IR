detection ssh brute force attack use aggregate netflow data intrusion detectionbrute forcemachine learningaggregated netflows ssh brute force attack one most prevalent attack computer network these attack aim gain ineligible access user account by try plenty different password combination detection this type attack network level overcome scalability issue hostbased detection method this paper provide machine learn approach detection ssh brute force attack network level since extract discriminative feature any machine learning task fundamental step explain process extract discriminative feature detection brute force attack incorporate domain knowledge about ssh brute force attack well analysis representative collection data define feature collect real ssh traffic from campus network also generate some failed login data that legitimate user who forget hisher password produce normal traffic that similar ssh brute force attack traffic our inspection collect brute force netflow data manually produce ssh fail login data show that netflow feature not discriminative enough discern brute force traffic from fail login traffic produce by legitimate user introduce an aggregation netflows extract proper feature build machine learning model our result show that model build upon these feature provide excellent performance detection brute force attack
