investigate transfer learner robustness domain class imbalance transfer learningdomain class imbalancetraditional machine learningclass imbalance transfer learn environment characterize by machine learn algorithm be train with data from one domain source domain be test data from different domain target domain transfer learn scenario class probability source domain may different from class probability target domain which refer domain class imbalance domain class imbalance different from class imbalance class imbalance refers condition single domain have unequal class probability traditional machine learn train test data drawn from single domain effect class imbalance traditional machine learn well study however issue domain class imbalance field transfer learn receive little research attention this paper provide comparative performance test stateoftheart transfer learn algorithms use widerange domain class imbalance combination detailed discussion relative performance different algorithm with statistical validation present different domain class imbalance scenario
