graphical model base approach fault diagnosis wind turbine lasso estimate wind turbine pitch system wind turbine operation maintenance cost depend reliability it component thus critical task detect isolate fault fast possible restore optimal operating condition shortest time this paper machine learn graphical model approach propose fault diagnosis wind turbine particular pitch system role latter adjust blade pitch angle by rotate it accord current wind speed order optimize wind turbine power production this achieve by controller base blade pitch angle measure by two redundant sensor each blade without sensor accuracy read controller mislead fail achieve optimal control strategy accord current operation condition addition pitch angle sensor complete failure lead dangerous action controller while fix or drift bias sensor measurement may decrease controller efficiency good control overcome these challenge propose methodology that base gaussian acyclic graphical model lasso estimate methodology show ability model diagnose fault that occur pitch system wind turbine during it normal run could lead fast recovery optimal operating condition
