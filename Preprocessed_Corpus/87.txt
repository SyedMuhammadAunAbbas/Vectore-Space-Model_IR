incremental svd insight into wind generation vectorsmatrix decompositionapproximation methodssingular value decompositionwind speed this paper formulate problem predict wind generation one streaming data analysis want understand if it possible use weather data time window just before current time gain insight into how wind generation might behave time interval just after current time specifically use singular value decomposition weather data how that number singular value large singular value use predict magnitude change generation near future analysis use an incremental algorithm base slide window reduce computational cost
