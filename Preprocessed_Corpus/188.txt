intelligent bus stop identification use smartphone sensor intelligent systemsbus transportationmachine learninggpssensors intelligent transportation system build by develop model that learn from collect transport data data collection implementation such system often costly few country support such system their transportation budget place where maintain currency accuracy information difficult many problem arise instance chennai india real time bus transit data not maintain there proper communication about bus schedule bus stop not regularly updated inconsistent information about bus stop observe transport authority website interested develop model identify bus stop from trajectory situation where accurate current information not available traffic condition challenge such chennai india develop simple yet easily accessible android mobile application app collect gps trace bus route use our app collect gps trajectory data from baltimore maryland place where there facility access uptodate information about bus stop also collect gps trajectory from chennai india then develop model use machine learn technique identify bus stop from collect trajectory experimentally evaluate our model by train it baltimore dataset test it chennai dataset achieve test accuracy between this comparable accuracy achieve by both train test chennai dataset this illustrate that our approach effective help maintain an accurate current transport information system resource constraint environment
