forecast domestic hot water demand residential house use artificial neural network artificial neural networkdomestic hot waterforecasting energy demand prediction domestic hot water energy consumption key purpose order decrease energy consume residential house advantage use artificial neural network method it capacity adapt particular consumer without consumption profile lot paper develop artificial neural network model predict energy consumption but they use high quantity parametersin this study develop model with only available information classical installation separate our experimental data three kind instant nearzero consumptionlow consumption high consumption moment compare result three model base neural network method each these kind consumption measure reaction time between prediction real consumption moment result show that our model give good accuracy predict moment consumption value high consumption moment
