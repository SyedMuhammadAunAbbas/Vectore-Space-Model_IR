class decomposition use kmeans hierarchical cluster class decompositionclassificationclusteringmachine learn this paper present clusteringbased class decomposition approach improve performance classifier class decomposition work by divide each class into cluster by relabeling instance contain by each cluster with new class several case study use class decomposition combine with linear classifier while there an essential improvement classification accuracy because class decomposition most effective clustering algorithm not obvious aim this work investigate effect two cluster algorithm kmeans hierarchical class decomposition this work study class decomposition when combine with naive bayes classifier use four realworld datasets experimental result show an improvement classification accuracy most datasets when class decomposition use both kmeans hierarchical cluster perform result also show that class decomposition not suitable datasets
