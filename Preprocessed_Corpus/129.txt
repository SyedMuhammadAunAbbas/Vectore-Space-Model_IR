optimize attack surface configuration diversity use multiobjective reinforcement learn multiobjective reinforcement learningcybersecuritymoving target defense minimize attack surface system introduce diversity into system two effective way improve system security however determine how include diversity system without increase attack surface more than necessary difficult problem require knowledge about system characteristic operate environment available permutation that generally not available prior system deployment propose view system component interface communication channel set state action that analyze use sequential decision make process use multiobjective reinforcement learn algorithm learn set policy that minimize system attack surface execute those policy obtain configuration diversity while system operate describe methodology design system such that it component behavior translate into multiobjective markov decision process demonstrate use multiobjective reinforcement learn learn set optimal policy use three different multiobjective reinforcement learn algorithms context an online file share application show that our multiobjective temporal difference afterstate algorithm outperform alternative example problem
