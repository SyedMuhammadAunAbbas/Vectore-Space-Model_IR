well case adaptation method casebased effort estimation use multiobjective optimization multiobjective particle swarm optimization casebased reason adaptation method software effort estimation casebased reason cbr consider one efficient method area software effort estimation because it outstanding performance capability handle noisy datasets this study examine performance multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm find best configuration parameter adaptation process particularly propose new adaptation method which it parameter optimize by make trade off between multiple accuracy measure propose adaptation fully automate able dynamically adapt each case dataset individually base empirical validation over datasets performance figure see good improvement against conventional cbr some adapt version cbr
