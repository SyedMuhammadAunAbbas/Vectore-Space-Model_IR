influence sample reconstruction stock trend prediction via narx neural network trend predictionstock trading pointsnarxsample reconstructionartificial neural network our study through establish narx neural network model sample data stock aapl nasdaq from utilized training result show that under same sampling frequency with increase ma period trend volatility become low with obvious long time delay which will help predict trend movement addition through use reconstruct data contain trend information training sample it significantly reduce prediction error which low than use daily train sample low than use weekly training sample output directly reflect probability trend movement every time point stock price it also improve generalization ability narx model so predict stock trend change certain time it successfully estimate possibility buying selling point which provide necessary theoretical basis how determine stock trading point
