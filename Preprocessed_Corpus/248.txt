correlate filter diversity with convolutional neural network accuracy convolutional neural networkregularizationnormalizationpreprocessing this paper describe three metric use ass filter diversity learn by convolutional neural network during supervised classification our testbed use four different data set include two subset imagenet two planktonic data set collect by scientific instrument investigate correlation between our devised metric accuracy use normalization regularization alter filter diversity propose that these metric could use improve training cnns three potential application determine best preprocessing method nonstandard data set diagnose train efficacy predict performance case where validation data expensive or impossible collect
