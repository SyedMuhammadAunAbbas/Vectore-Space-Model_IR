coordinate descent fuzzy twin support vector machine classification coordinate descentfuzzyactive set shrinkinghighdimensional inputtsvmsvm this paper develop novel coordinate descent fuzzy twin svm cdftsvm classification propose cdftsvm not only inherit advantage twin svm but also lead rapid robust classification result specifically our cdftsvm two distinguish advantage an effective fuzzy membership function produce remove noise incur by contaminant input coordinate descent strategy with shrinking by active set use deal with computational complexity bring by high dimensional input addition series simulation experiment conduct verify performance cdftsvm which far support our previous claim
