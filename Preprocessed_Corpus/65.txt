uncertainty quantify matrix completion use bayesian hierarchical matrix factorization bayesian analysis probabilistic matrix factorization uncertainty quantification lowrank matrix completion method be successful variety setting such recommendation system however most exist matrix completion method only provide point estimate miss entry not characterize uncertainty prediction this paper propose bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization bhpmf model incorporate hierarchical side information provide uncertainty quantified prediction former yield significant performance improvement problem plant trait prediction key problem ecology by leverage taxonomic hierarchy plant kingdom latter helpful identify prediction low confidence which turn use guide field work data collection effort gibbs sampler design inference model far propose multiple inheritance bhpmf mibhpmf which work with general direct acyclic graph dag structure hierarchy rather than tree present comprehensive experimental result problem plant trait prediction use large database plant trait where bhpmf show strong empirical performance uncertainty quantify trait prediction outperform stateoftheart base point estimate far show that bhpmf more accurate when it confident whereas error high when uncertainty high
