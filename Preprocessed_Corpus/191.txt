augment interactive evolution with multiobjective optimization interactive evolutionary computationmultiobjective evolutionary algorithmnovelty searchserendipitous discovery deceptive fitness landscape grow concern field evolutionary computation recent work demonstrate that incorporate human insight with shortterm automate evolution synergistic effect that ease deception accelerate discovery solution while human evaluator provide rich insight into domain they fatigue easily previous work reduce number human evaluation by evolve diverse set candidate via intermittent search novelty while successful evolve solution deceptive maze domain it lack ability measure solution quality that human evaluator implicitly identify important key insight this paper that multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moeas foster diversity that nondominated set serve surrogate novelty while measure user preference data this new approach call pareto optimalityassisted interactive evolutionary computation poaiec leverage human intuition by allow user identify candidate nondominated set that they feel promise interestingly experimental result demonstrate that poaiec find solution significantly few evaluation than previous approach that nondominated set contains significantly more novel behavior than dominate set this way poaiec simultaneously leverages human insight while quantify their preference
