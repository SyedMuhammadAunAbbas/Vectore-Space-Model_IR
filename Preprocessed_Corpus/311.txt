early identification vulnerable software component via ensemble learn vulnerabilityensemble learningsupport vector machinemislabeled data software component which vulnerable be exploit need identify patched employ any prevention technique design purpose detect vulnerable software component early stage reduce expense associate with software test process significantly thus help build more reliable robust software system although previous study demonstrate effectiveness adapt prediction technique vulnerability detection feasibility those technique limit mainly because insufficient training data set this paper propose prediction technique target early identification potentially vulnerable software component propose scheme potentially vulnerable component view mislabeled data that may contain true but not yet observe vulnerability propose hybrid technique combine support vector machine algorithm ensemble learn strategy well identify potential vulnerable component propose vulnerability detection scheme evaluate use some java android application result demonstrate that propose hybrid technique could identify potentially vulnerable class with high precision relatively acceptable accuracy recall
