impact noise from groupbased label collection visual classification visual classificationnoisy train datagroup base label state art visual classification continue improve particularly with use deep learning million label image however effort require label train set this size lead semisupervised approach that collect partially noisy label data with less effort label noise be show degrade supervise learn but these analysis focus noise from erroneous label assignment data instance groupbased label reduces workload by assign single label group image simultaneously which introduce label noise with structure dependent training instance this work investigate impact groupbased label noise classifier learn discuss how why this differs from instancebased label noise also discuss label noise modeling design provide more robust classification give noisy training instance evaluate generalization these technique groupbased noise
