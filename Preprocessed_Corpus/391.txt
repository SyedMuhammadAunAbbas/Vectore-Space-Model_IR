eyequal accurate explainable retinal image quality assessment weakly supervise learningmultiple instance learningmedical image analysisretinal imagequality assessment give retinal image automatically determine whether it high quality suitable medical diagnosis also explain our decision pinpoint region or region that lead our decision image from human retina vital diagnosis multiple health issue like hypertension diabetes alzheimers low quality image may force patient come back again second scan wasting time possibly delay treatment however exist retinal image quality assessment method either black box without explanation result or depend heavily feature engineering or complex errorprone anatomical structure segmentation therefore propose eyequal that solve exactly this problem eyequal novel fast inference accurate explainable pinpoint lowquality region image evaluate eyequal two real datasets where it achieve accuracy take just millisecond each image
