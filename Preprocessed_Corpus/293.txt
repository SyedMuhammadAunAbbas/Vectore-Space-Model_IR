detect smooth cluster change evolve graphs spectral clusteringevolving graphgraph sequence cluster vertex graph or sequence graph important application network science bioinformatics other area most research date focus static graph or sequence where number vertex do not change propose new algorithm that successfully partition vertex graph sequence into smooth cluster even when number vertex allow vary over time our approach use spectral cluster relies apply k partition problem graph construct from input graph sequence several experiment demonstrate performance our method it advantage over exist method
