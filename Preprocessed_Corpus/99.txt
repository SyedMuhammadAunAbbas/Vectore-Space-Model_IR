machinesourced segmentation vs expertsourced segmentation classification lung nodule with outlier removal machinesourced computeraided diagnosis crowdsourcing lung cancer segmentation computeraided diagnosis system provide additional opinion that serve an aid radiologists early detection lung nodule previous cad model rely radiologistdelineated contour extract image feature classify lung nodule into semantic rating manually create these contour timeconsuming expensive this paper propose different cad system base multiple machinesourced segmentation that provide semantic rating least accurate panel expert order aid diagnostic process however mass production machinesourced segmentation may sometimes produce unwanted noise therefore propose filter out bad segmentation by apply an outlier detection algorithm that identifies segmentation that far away from majority segmentation our result compare cad system base expertsourced contour reference truth generate by radiologist semantic rating use lung image database consortium dataset show that machinesourced segmentation provide prediction least good expertsourced segmentation how outlier removal affect mostly shapedependent semantic rating
