learn effective query management strategy from big data query relaxationfunctional dependencyweb base information source availability big data collection together with powerful hardware software mechanisms process them give nowadays possibility learn useful insight from data which exploit multiple purpose include marketing fault prevention so forth however it also possible learn important metadata that suggest how data should manipulate several advanced operation this paper show potentiality learn from data by focus problem relax result database query that try return some approximated answer query when result it unavailable database system will return an empty answer set or even bad erroneous mismatch result particular introduce novel approach rewrite query that disjunctive normal form contain mixture discrete continuous attribute approach preprocesses data collection discover implicit relationship that exist among various domain attribute then use this knowledge rewrite constraint from fail query first step approach try learn set functional dependency from data which rank accord special mechanism that will successively allow predict order which extract dependency use properly rewrite fail query an experimental evaluation approach three real data set show it effectiveness term robustness coverage
