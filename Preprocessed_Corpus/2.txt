improve spectral learning by use multiple representation representation spectral learn discrete fourier basis selection ensemble spectral learn algorithm learn an unknown function by learn spectral eg fourier representation function however there many possible spectral representation none which will best situation consequently it seem natural consider how spectral learner could make use multiple representation when learn this paper propose compare three approach learn from multiple spectral representation empirical result suggest that an ensemble approach multispectrum learn which spectral model learn independently each set candidate representation then combine majorityvote ensemble work best practice
