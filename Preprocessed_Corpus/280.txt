bird call identification use dynamic kernel base support vector machine deep neural network bioacousticsbird call identificationdynamic kernelssupport vector machinesdeep neural network this paper apply speech audio processing technique bird vocalization classification bird find low himalayan region mel frequency cepstral coefficient mfcc extract from each record result recording now represent vary length set feature vector dynamic kernel base support vector machine svms deep neural network dnns popularly use classification such varying length pattern obtain from speech signal this work propose use dynamic kernel base svms dnns classification bird call represent set feature vector result our study show that both approach give comparable performance
