privacypreserving solution bipartite rank problem bipartite rank problemprivacypreservingdata mining this paper propose an efficient solution privacypreserving bipartite ranking algorithm bipartite ranking problem consider find function that rank positive instance dataset high than negative one however one common concern exist scheme privacy individual dataset that one eg researcher need access record individual dataset order run algorithm this privacy concern put limitation use sensitive personal data such analysis rimarc rank instance by maximize area under roc curve algorithm solve bipartite ranking problem by learn model rank instance part model it learn weight each feature by analyze area under receiver operating characteristic roc curve rimarc algorithm show more accurate efficient than it counterpart thus use this algorithm buildingblock provide privacypreserving version rimarc algorithm use homomorphic encryption secure multiparty computation our propose algorithm let data owner outsource storage process it encrypted dataset semitrusted cloud then researcher get result hisher query learn rank function dataset by interact with cloud during this process neither researcher nor cloud learn any information about raw dataset prove security propose algorithm show it efficiency via experiment real data
