ensemble statistical heuristic model unsupervised word alignment statistical word alignment ensemble learn heuristic word alignment statistical word alignment model need large amount training data while they weak smallsize corpus this paper propose new approach unsupervised hybrid word alignment technique use ensemble learn method this algorithm use three base alignment model several round generate alignment ensemble algorithm us weigh scheme resampling training data vote score consider aggregate alignment underlie alignment algorithm use this study include ibm model heuristic method base dice measurement our experimental result show that by this approach alignment error rate could improve by least base alignment model
