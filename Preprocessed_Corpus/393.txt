compare transfer learn traditional learn under domain class imbalance transfer learningdomain class imbalancetraditional machine learn transfer learn subclass machine learn which use train data source drawn from different domain than that test data target transfer learn environment characterize by unavailability label data from target domain due data be rare or too expensive obtain however there exist abundant label data from different but similar domain these two domain likely different distribution characteristic transfer learn algorithms attempt align distribution characteristic source target domains create highperformance classifier this paper provide comparative performance analysis between stateof theart transfer learn algorithms traditional machine learn algorithms under domain class imbalance condition domain class imbalance condition characterize by source target domains have different class probability which create marginal distribution difference between source target data statistical analysis provide show significance result
