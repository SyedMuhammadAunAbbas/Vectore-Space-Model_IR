robust kernel embed conditional posterior distribution with application bayesian inferencezeroshot learningkernel method this paper propose novel nonparametric method robustly embed conditional posterior distribution reproduce kernel hilbert space rkhs robust embedding obtain by eigenvalue decomposition rkhs by retain only lead eigenvectors noise data methodically disregard nonparametric conditional posterior distribution embed obtain by our method apply wide range bayesian inference problem this paper apply it heterogeneous face recognition zeroshot object recognition problem experimental validation show that our method produce good result than comparative algorithm
