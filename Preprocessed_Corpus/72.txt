comparison supervise machine learn technique predict shortterm inhospital length stay among diabetic patient inhospital length stay prediction supervise machine learn support vector machine support vector machine plus random forest multitask learn diabetes diabetes lifealtering medical condition that affect million people result many hospitalization per year consequently predict length stay inhospital diabetic patient become increasingly important staff resource planning although statistical method be use predict length stay hospitalize patient many powerful machine learn technique not yet be explore this paper compare discuss performance various supervise machine learn algorithms ie multiple linear regression support vector machine multitask learn random forest predict long versus shortterm length stay hospitalize diabetic patient
