an oblivious routingbased power flow calculation method loss minimization smart power network theoretical perspective large scale network flowloss minimizationoblivious rout schemepower system power loss minimization play an important role appropriate operation power network line power loss occur when power transmit through line network due permittivity line medium transmission loss may increase dispatch cost obtain power flow base market contract hence independent system operator should use loss minimization method facilitate implementation contract power transaction loss minimization also will improve security stability power network this paper present novel loss minimization scheme base oblivious network design refer oblivious routingbased power flow method method build bottomup oblivious network rout scheme which offer multiple path from several source generation unit specific destination electric load demand although there limited information regard other line flow current status network rout scheme mathematically guarantee that power flow solution an approximation optimal solution with specific competitiveness ratio fact our main focus power flow calculation while optimize power loss compare with recently develop power flow method our approach do not depend network topology it performance both radial nonradial network accurate hence it suitable use propose approach largescale loss minimization while determine power flow this paper mainly focus theoretical aspect propose method our method base novel concept from computer science discipline provide sufficient explanation about preliminary oblivious rout scheme
