complex decomposition negative distance kernel svmkernel functionstext categorization support vector machine svm become very popular machine learn method text classification one reason this relate range exist kernel which allow classify data that not linearly separable linear polynomial rbf gaussian radial basis function kernel commonly use serve basis comparison our study show how derive primal form quadratic power kernel pk also call negative euclidean distance kernel ndk by mean complex number exemplify ndk framework text categorization use dewey document classification ddc target scheme our evaluation show that power kernel produce fscores that comparable reference kernel but except linear kernel faster compute finally show how extend ndkapproach by include mahalanobis distance
