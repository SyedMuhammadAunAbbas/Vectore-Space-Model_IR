recognize human activity from raw accelerometer data use deep neural network activity recognitiondeep neural networksfeature learningaccelerometer data activity recognition from wearable sensor data be research many year previous work usually extract feature manually which be handdesigned by researcher then be feed into classifier input due blindness manually extracted feature it be hard choose suitable feature specific classification task besides this heuristic method feature extraction could not generalize across different application domain because different application domain need extract different feature classification there be also work that use autoencoders learn feature automatically then feed feature into knearest neighbor classifier however these feature be learn an unsupervised manner without use information label thus might not relate specific classification task this paper recommend deep neural network dnns activity recognition which automatically learn suitable feature dnns overcome blindness handdesigned feature make use precious label information improve activity recognition performance do experiment three publicly available datasets activity recognition compare deep neural network with traditional method include those that extract feature manually autoencoders follow by knearest neighbor classifier result show that deep neural network could generalize across different application domain get high accuracy than traditional method
