transient characteristic dcdc converter with pid parameter selection neural network control neural network dcdc converter pid control this paper present neural network base pid parameter selection control improve transient response dcdc converter conventional pid control parameter it such proportional integral differential coefficient select fixed parameter regulate both transient steadystate characteristic simultaneously much possible parameter set pid control not optimal improvement transientstate characteristic since set need satisfy stable steadystate characteristic therefore parameter selection different state widely applicable from point view improvement transient response this study present novel parameter selection method pid control base load change prediction neural network improve transient response dcdc converter present method suitable pid parameter select with neural network this neural network train predict load change from output voltage dcdc converter advance from predict result neural network pid parameter change optimal one after load change occur additionally reference modification with another neural network which train modify reference value pid control also adopt simultaneously obtain more effective improvement transient response from evaluation result confirm that our presented method contributes obtain an effective improvement transient response compare conventional pid control
