semisupervised kernelbased temporal cluster kernel kmeans semisupervised cluster temporal segmentation this paper adapt two exist method perform semisupervised temporal clustering align cluster analysis aca temporal cluster algorithm constrain spectral clustering semisupervised cluster algorithm first method add side information form pairwise constraints it objective function second add temporal search it framework also extend both method by propagate constraint throughout whole similarity matrix order validate advantage propose semisupervised method temporal cluster evaluate them comparison their original version well another semisupervised temporal cluster three temporal datasets result show that propose method competitive provide good improvement over unsupervised approach
