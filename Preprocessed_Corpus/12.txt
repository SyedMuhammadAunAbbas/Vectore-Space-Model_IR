an accurate fast embed feature selection svms rfe feature selection embed method support vector machine recursive feature addition feature selection still vital area research machine learn field after emergence big data need mine large data size increase provide faster more accurate prediction feature selection concern with select most important feature from set input feature since some datasets may contain irrelevant andor redundant feature this paper new feature selection method type embed present discuss with some preliminary result use exist benchmark datasets new method call recursive feature addition which work forward fashion base support vector machine new method be apply five different benchmark datasets which it show superior performance term accuracy time compare filter wrapper other embed method
