parametric exponential linear unit deep convolutional neural network activation functiondeep learning object recognition an important task improve ability visual system perform complex scene understand recently exponential linear unit elu be propose key component manage bias shift convolutional neural network cnns but define parameter that must set by hand this paper propose learn parameterization elu order learn proper activation shape each layer cnns our result mnist imagenet datasets use nin overfeat allcnn resnet network indicate that our propose parametric elu pelu good performance than nonparametric elu observe much relative error improvement imagenet with nin network with only parameter increase our visual examination nonlinear behavior adopt by vgg use pelu show that network take advantage added flexibility by learn different activation different layer
