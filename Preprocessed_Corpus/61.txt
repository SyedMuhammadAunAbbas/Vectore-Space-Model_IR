protein conformation motion model use sepcmaes mass transfer cmaes protein conformation conformation motion problem protein conformation motion model an open problem structural computational biology it difficult solve it use method molecular dynamic or quantum physic because these method deal with time interval nanosecond or microsecond while conformation motion take time millisecond order addition these method not take external force into consideration cope with these problem numerous approximate coarsegrained method develop which use idea from geometry motion planningwe present new coarsegrained method model protein motion between two give conformation method base optimization cost function similar one mongekantorovich mass transfer problem optimization perform use sepcmaes which make run time an iteration linear number amino acid protein propose method compare with some exist method several molecule it show that result propose method more accurate than other method
