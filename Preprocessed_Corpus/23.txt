facial expression recognition use kinect depth sensor convolutional neural network convolutional neural network cnn facial expression recognition facial expression recognition an active area research with application design human computer interaction hci system this paper propose an approach facial expression recognition use deep convolutional neural network cnn base feature generate from depth information only gradient direction information depth data use represent facial information due it invariance distance from sensor ability convolutional neural network cnn learn local discriminative pattern from data use recognize facial expression from representation unregistered facial image experiment conduct eurecom kinect face dataset demonstrate effectiveness propose approach
