mapreduce base classification fault detection big data application fault detectionbig dataapplicationsmapreducebayesian classification recently emerge software application large complex distribute dataintensive ie big data application that make monitoring such application challenge task due lack standard technique model analysis execution data ie log produce by such application another challenge impose by big data application that execution data produce by such application also high volume velocity variety require high veracity value this paper present our monitoring solution that perform realtime fault detection big data application our solution twofold first prescribe standard model structure execution log second prescribe bayesian classification base analysis solution that mapreduce compliant distribute parallel single pas incremental that make it possible our propose solution deploy execute cloud compute platform process log produce by big data application carry out complexity scalability usability analysis our propose solution that how efficiently effectively it perform fault detection big data application
