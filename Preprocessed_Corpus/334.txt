differentiation integration machine learn feature vector kernel methodclassificationgene coexpression networkscancer this paper present new approach production feature map improvement classification machine learn idea base calculus differentiation integration feature vector which view function metric space or network base this propose novel networkbased binary machine learn classifier illustrate our method use molecular network alone distinguish phenotype include cancer type subtypes include feature set derive from diseasespecific gene coexpression network different cancer data set use cancer genome atlas tcga along with other previously publish study also illustrate our networkbased predictor another data type base infrared spectroscopy lung cancer tissue
