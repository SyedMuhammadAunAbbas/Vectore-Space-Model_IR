evaluate uncertainty bayesian network query response by use joint probability distribution bayesian networkmachine learningeffective sample sizevariance query responseapproximate inference bayesian network powerful tool represent pattern inside past data it use predict future by calculate posterior probability future event machine learn technique that construct bayesian network from past data automatically well developed recent year if consider past data sample set from an original probabilistic distribution learn process actually try reproduce original probabilistic distribution from sample set therefore finiteness size sample set will bring uncertainty reproduce parameter construct bayesian network when construct bayesian network use predict future uncertainty reproduce parameter will transfer uncertainty query response here query response posterior probability that interested evaluate uncertainty query response critical some strict industrial application previous research propose method evaluate uncertainty consequence show variance query response however conventional method need work together with bucket elimination an exact inference method therefore conventional method not deal with large bayesian network that use real application because it calculation cost propose new approach calculate uncertainty query response by use joint probability distribution this research propose method work with any inference method therefore it give an approximate evaluation even when bayesian network large by use an approximate inference method investigate accuracy our propose method six well use public bayesian network use test case by compare approximate result with exact result an average error get
