consensus cluster resamplingbased method building radiation hybrid map radiation hybrid mappingclusteringresampling building radiation hybrid rh map challenge process traditional rh map technique very time consume not work well noisy datasets this present research propose new approach that use resampling technique with consensus cluster technique filter out unreliable marker build robust rh map short time main aim use propose approach first reduce map computational complexity thus speed map process second filter out unreliable marker map remain reliable marker build robust map propose approach map rh datasets four step follow us jackknife resampling technique resample rh dataset group resampled datasets into cluster build consensus cluster filter out unreliable marker map consensus cluster connect consensus cluster map form final map demonstrate performance our propose approach compare accuracy construct map with correspond physical map also compare run time our constructed map with carthagene tool map run time result show that propose approach construct robust map comparatively very short time
