toward an online anomaly intrusion detection system base deep learn intrusiondetectiondbnrbmattackscyber securityneural networkmachine learningdata mining past twenty year progress intrusion detection be steady but slow big challenge detect new attack real time this work deep learn approach anomaly detection use restrict boltzmann machine rbm deep belief network implement our method use onehidden layer rbm perform unsupervised feature reduction resultant weight from this rbm pass another rbm produce deep belief network pretrained weight pass into fine tune layer consist logistic regression lr classifier with multiclass softmax implement deep learning architecture c microsoft visual studio use darpa dataset evaluate it performance our architecture outperform previous deep learning method implement by li salama both detection speed accuracy achieve detection rate total test dataset by improve train process simulation also able produce low false negative rate although deficiency dataset well understood it still present machine learn approach predict attack with reasonable challenge our future work will include apply our machine learn strategy large more challenging datasets which include large class attack
