understading image restoration convolutional neural network with network inversion deep learningneural networksunderwaterdehazingvisualizationimage restoration recent year convolutional neural network cnns achieve stateoftheart performance many image restoration application knowledge how these model work however still limit while there be many attempt well understand inner work cnns they mostly be apply classification network because this most existing cnn visualization technique may inadequate study image restoration architectures paper present network inversion new method develop specifically help understand image restoration convolutional neural network apply our method underwater image restoration dehazing cnns show how it help understand improvement these model
