investigate new bootstrapping approach bag classifier account class imbalance bioinformatics datasets class imbalancebaggingbootstrap approachesbioinformatics one major challenge pose by bioinformatics datasets class imbalance which occur when one class many more instance than other class it undesirable effect classification performance compound with fact that general class with few instance class interest bag be utilize by practitioner field overcome challenge class imbalance improve classification performance our motivation this study investigate whether change bootstrapping step bag classifier far improve their performance specifically these modification bootstrapping process take into account membership class perform an extensive empirical study utilize four bootstrap approach within bag framework use three feature ranker along with four feature subset size two base classifier across imbalanced bioinformatics datasets three these bootstrap approach be propose implement by our research team this study our result show that new approach improve performance over classic bootstrap approach with balanced bag have high performance however observe increase performance not statistically significant recommend balance bootstrap approach because it show most improvement term frequency have high performance it generate fully balance bootstrap datasets that account class imbalance problem uniqueness this paper propose implement three innovative bootstrapping approach examine effect these bootstrapping process against classic one performance bag classifier domain bioinformatics
