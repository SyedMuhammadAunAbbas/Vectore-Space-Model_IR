switchandrestart algorithm with exponential restart strategy objective selection it runtime analysis runtime analysis objective selection algorithm selection online selection earl there exist optimization problem with target objective which optimize several extra objective which may or may not helpful optimization process this paper consider case when it possible find an optimum target objective by optimize either target objective or single extra objective an algorithm present that use single instance an underlying singleobjective optimization algorithm optimize different objective different iteration restarts optimization algorithm between optimize different objective this algorithm expect running time most k mino until an optimum target objective find where expect running time underlie optimization algorithm find an optimum target objective by optimize objective o an impact not use restarts between iteration also discuss
