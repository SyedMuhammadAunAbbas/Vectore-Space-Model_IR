use spectral feature improve sentiment analysis feature discovery spectral learn discrete fourier sentiment analysis common approach sentiment classification identify set sentimentcarrying word then use machine learning build classifier that classify sentiment base presenceabsence those word this paper propose fourierbased extension this approach specifically introduce spectral learn algorithm that implicitly identify sentimentcarrying word higherorder function those word it learn assign realvalued sentiment score document spectral learner extend word presence model by apply boolean logic operator or xor word presence feature identify useful higherorder feature these spectral feature use other learn algorithms show how performance other learn algorithm improve by these feature finally consider problem determine which pair review express more positive overall sentiment show that spectral learner identify very small distinction sentiment with betterthanrandom accuracy while large distinction correctly identify with high accuracy
