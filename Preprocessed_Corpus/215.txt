frequent set mining stream mixed large data frequent set miningdiscretizationlarge datamixed datastreaming frequent set mining well research problem due it application many area data mining such cluster classification association rule mine most existing work focus categorical batch data not scale well large datasets this work focus frequent set mining mixed data introduce discretization methodology find meaningful bin boundary when itemsets contain least one continuous attribute an update strategy keep frequent item relevant event concept drift parallel algorithm find these frequent item our approach identify local bin per itemset global discretization may not identify most meaningful bin since relationship between attribute my change over time rule update use weighted average method our algorithm fit well hadoop framework so it scale large datasets
