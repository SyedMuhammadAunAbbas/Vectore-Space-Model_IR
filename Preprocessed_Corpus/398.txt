noise prediction timedomain subtraction approach deep neural network base speech enhancement speech enhancementdeep neural networksnoise estimationspeech qualityspeech intelligibility deep neural network dnns recently be successfully apply speech enhancement task however low signaltonoise ratio snr performance dnnbased speech enhancement system remain less than desirable this paper study an approach dnnbased speech enhancement base noise prediction three speech enhancement model base noise prediction propose their performance compare that conventional spectralmapping model see unseen noise test objective test result show that propose noise prediction model perform well enhance speech quality see noise condition enhance high snr speech signal they also perform well enhance speech intelligibility both see unseen noise condition but not outperform conventional model quality metric unseen noise condition far analysis enhance speech signal undertaken explain observed result
