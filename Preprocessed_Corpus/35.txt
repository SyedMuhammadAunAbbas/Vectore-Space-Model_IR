variational inference infinite mixture inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression variational inference probit regression exponential regression inverse gaussian regression dirichlet process introduce new class method inference technique infinite mixture inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression model that belong widely applicable framework generalize linear model glm characterize joint distribution response covariates via stickbreaking prior this lead various case nonparametric model an infinite mixture inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression estimate localize mean function which map covariates response present prove weak consistency posterior distribution exponential model sbex then propose mean field variational inference algorithm inverse gaussian multinomial probit exponential regression finally demonstrate their superior accuracy comparison several other regression model such gaussian process regression dirichlet process regression etc
