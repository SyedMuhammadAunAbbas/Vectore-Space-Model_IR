deep transductive nonnegative matrix factorization speech separation nonnegative matrix factorizationdeep learningtransductive learningspeech separation nonnegative matrix factorization nmf attract great attention speech separation it preserve nonnegativity property magnitude spectrogram speech signal however nmf sometimes performs poorly because it not extract nonlinear feature speech this paper propose deep transductive nmf model dtnmf which incorporate multilayer structure into nmf learns share dictionary source signal each speaker mixture signal separate since multilayer structure enable dtnmf learn more precise presentation source signal with nonlinear feature extract dtnmf significantly enhance performance speech separation experimental result nonnegative matrix factorization nmf attract great attention speech separation it preserve nonnegativity property magnitude spectrogram speech signal however nmf sometimes performs poorly because it not extract nonlinear feature speech this paper propose deep transductive nmf model dtnmf which incorporate multilayer structure into nmf learns share dictionary source signal each speaker mixture signal separate since multilayer structure enable dtnmf learn more precise presentation source signal with nonlinear feature extract dtnmf significantly enhance performance speech separation experimental result popular librispeech dataset show that dtnmf outperforms representative nmf model separate mixture singlechannel speech signal
