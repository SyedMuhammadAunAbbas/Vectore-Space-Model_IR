finite gamma mixture modelbased discriminative learning framework mixture modelsgamma distributiongenerative learningsvmobject shapesvideo event it wellknown that classification task approach use either generative model or discriminative one while goal generative approach learn classconditional density main goal discriminative technique learn decision boundary directly without take into account classconditional density classic supervise learning would usually represent give object an image instance by vector d realvalued feature then select give generative or discriminative approach perform classification many application however object represent by set or bag vector recent development machine learn along with powerful computational tool enable researcher develop more sophisticated model handle such application use socalled hybrid generative discriminative model main idea base exploiting advantage both family model thus success such an approach depend choice an appropriate discriminative technique suitable generative one goal this paper develop hybrid generative discriminative framework base support vector machine gamma mixture particular focus generation kernel when example image instance structure data ie describe by set vector model by gamma mixture experimental result realworld challenge application namely shape class recognition object categorization video event analysis show effectiveness propose framework
