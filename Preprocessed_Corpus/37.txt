learn score system patient mortality prediction intensive care unit via orthogonal match pursuit logistic regression intensive care unit mortality rate prediction score system orthogonal matching pursuit problem predict outcome patient intensive care unit icus great importance critical care medicine wide implication quality control icu dominant approach this problem be use an icu score system such acute physiology chronic health evaluation apache system simplify acute physiology score sap system compute certain severity score patient from set clinical observation apply logistic regression model this score obtain an estimate probability mortality patient owe their simplicity these method widely use by clinician however exist icu score system which build from fix set patient data often perform poorly when applied patient population with different characteristic also with change patient characteristic score system build from give patient data set becomes suboptimal over time moreover most these score system build use semiautomated procedure make it difficult adapt them new patient population thus there huge need adaptive method that automatically learn predictive model from give set patient data indeed there be much work recent year apply various machine learn method this problem however these method learn different representation from score system prefer by clinician this work develop machine learn method base orthogonal matching pursuit that automatically learn score system type model which enjoy benefit both world like other machine learn method it adaptive like standard score system it use representation that easy clinician understand experiment realworld patient data set show that our method outperform standard icu score system performs least well other machine learn method this problem
