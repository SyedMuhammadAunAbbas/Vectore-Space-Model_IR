performance analysis majority vote combiner multiple classifier system multiple classifier systemsmajority vote ruleprobability classification error combine rule multiple classifier system mcs play central role shape their performance classification error probability many theoretical work develop predict performance use different combining rule some develop work assume that classifier output independent however practice an ensemble classifier show dependent behavior between each other this work theoretical model derive estimate misclassification error probability mc base majority vote combiner derivation assume that each classifier produce it output an estimation posterior class probability that gaussian distribution addition assume that each classifier two class output classifier dependent identically distribute validate our model use computer simulation result show that ensemble performance highly sensitive class variance while exhibit smoother behavior against class mean also result show that correlation among classifier output increase probability classification error degrade exponentially trend continue until performance reach behavior single classifier regardless number base classifier use ensemble proposed model provide well understand behavior majority vote combiner mc
