dimensionality reduction statistical learn statistical learn dimensionality reduction manifold learning tangent bundle manifold learn unsupervised learn many statistical learn task deal with data which present high dimensional space curse dimensionality phenomenon often an obstacle use many method solve these task avoid these phenomena various dimensionality reduction algorithm use first key step solution these task algorithms transform original highdimensional data into their low dimensional representation such way that initial task may reduce correspond task construct lowerdimensional representation original dataset dimensionality reduction problem different formulation depend initial statistical learning task new geometrically motivate algorithm that solve various dimensionality reduction problem present
