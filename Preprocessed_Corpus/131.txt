hybrid method intrusion detection intrusion detectionknearest neighborgenetic algorithmnetwork attack intrusion detection system idss use detect malicious action information system such compute network system abnormal behavior or activity network system could detect by security system but conventional security system such antivirus firewall not successful many malicious action overcome this problem well more intelligent id solution require this study hybrid approach be propose use detect network attack genetic algorithm ga knearest neighbor knn method be combined model detect attack knn be employ classify attack ga be use select k neighbor an attack sample this hybrid system be first apply intrusion detection field system provide advantage such decreasing dependency full training data set provide plausible solution intrusion detection result show that proposed system provide good result than single system
