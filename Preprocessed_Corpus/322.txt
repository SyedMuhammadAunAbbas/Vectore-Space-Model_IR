hybrid machine learn approach planning safe trajectory complex trafficscenarios hybrid learn algorithmstrajectory plan road planning safe trajectory with intervention both lateral longitudinal dynamic vehicle huge potential increase road traffic safety main challenge development such algorithms consideration vehicle nonholonomic constraint efficiency term implementation so that algorithms run real time vehicle recently introduce augmented clrrt algorithm an approach that use analytical model trajectory plan base brute force evaluation many longitudinal acceleration profile find collisionfree trajectory algorithm considers nonholonomic constraint vehicle complex road traffic scenario with multiple static dynamic object but it require lot computation time this work propose hybrid machine learn approach predict suitable acceleration profile critical traffic scenario so that only few acceleration profile use with augmented clrrt find safe trajectory while reduce computation time this realize use convolutional neural network variant introduce which learn spatiotemporal feature from sequence predict occupancy grid generate from prediction other road traffic participant these learn feature together with handdesigned feature ego vehicle use predict acceleration profile simulation perform compare brute force approach with proposed approach term efficiency safety result show vast improvement term efficiency without harm safety additionally an extension augment clrrt algorithm introduce find trajectory with low severity injury if collision already unavoidable
