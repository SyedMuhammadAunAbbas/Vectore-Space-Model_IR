learn multivalued biological model with delayed influence from timeseries observation dynamical systemsmultivalued modelsboolean networksdelaymarkovklearning from interpretation transitioninductive logic program delayed effect important model biological system time boolean network be propose such framework yet it not an easy task design such boolean model with delay precisely recently an attempt learn time boolean network be make ribeiro et al framework learn state transition rule from timeseries data however this approach still two limitation maximum delay give input algorithm possible value each state assume boolean ie twovalued this paper extend previous learn mechanism overcome these limitation propose an algorithm learn multivalued biological model with delayed influence by automatically tune delay delay determine so minimally explain necessary influence merit our approach then verify benchmark come from challenge
