iterative hard thresholding keyword extraction from large text corpus text analysisinformation retrievaliterative methodsstatistical analysis well understand analyze text corpus such news it often useful extract keywords that meaningfully associate with give topic corpus document label by their topic use approach this learning problem consider this problem through lens statistical text analysis use bagofwords frequency feature sparse linear model demonstrate through numerical experiment that iterative hard thresholding iht practical effective algorithm keywordextraction from large text corpus fact our implementation iht quickly analyze more than document return keywords comparable algorithms solve lasso problemformulation with significantly less computation time further generalize analysis iht algorithm show that it stable rank deficient matrix those arise from our bagofwords model often
