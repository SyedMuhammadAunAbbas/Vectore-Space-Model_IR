infer gene regulatory network by combine supervise unsupervised method data miningmachine learningnetwork inferencesystems biology supervise method infer gene regulatory network grns perform well with good training data however when train data absent these method not applicable unsupervised method not need train data but their accuracy low this paper combine supervise unsupervised method infer grns use timeseries gene expression data specifically use result obtain from unsupervised method train supervise method since result contain noise develop data clean algorithm remove noise hence improve quality training data these refine training data then use guide classifier include support vector machine deep learn tool infer grns through link prediction experimental result several data set demonstrate good performance classifier effectiveness our data cleaning algorithm
