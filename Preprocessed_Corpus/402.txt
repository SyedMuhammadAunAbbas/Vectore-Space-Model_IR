adventure game with neural network control nonplaying character neural networksgenetic algorithmweb base gamesneuroevolution this paper present way evolve nonplaying character by control it through neural network then use genetic algorithm alter weight previous neural network data provide population from which select individual simulate result allow relative ranking that use fitness function treat select set neural network weight binary sequence program use crossover mutation create new set weight which subsequently evaluate through this process find that program creates well set neural network weight that relative ranking allow computercontrolled character range difficulty level implement this experiment part game
