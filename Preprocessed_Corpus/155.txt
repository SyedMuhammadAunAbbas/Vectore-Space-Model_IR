effective user authentication use keystroke dynamic base feature selection keystroke dynamicskeystroke featuresecurityauthenticationbiometrics efficient keystroke authentication system should ability capture build user pattern minimal time these system also should able achieve quick detection while maintain good detection accuracy however maintain high detection accuracy minimal detection delay conflicting requirement that need balance possible approach tackle this problem reduce number feature that need learn by classifier thereby decrease processing time wrapper base feature subset selection approach present this paper with objective reduce dimensionality user data through identify small subset feature that represent most discriminating feature keystrokes dynamic several feature selection technique such genetic greedy algorithm best first search algorithm particle swarm optimization pso use search best subset feature these selection technique integrate wrap with different machine learn classifier namely support vector machine svm naive bayesian nb k near neighbor knn feature subset selection procedure that automatically select most appropriate representative subset feature
