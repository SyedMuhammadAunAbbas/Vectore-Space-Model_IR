lsh v randomize partition tree which one use near neighbor search near neighbor search rp tree recently randomize partition tree be theoretically show very effective performing high dimensional near neighbor search this paper introduce variant randomize partition tree high dimensional near neighbor search problem provide theoretical justification it choice experiment various reallife datasets show that this new variant performs well than variant introduce also than locality sensitive hashing lsh method near neighbor search addition show an interesting connection between various notion difficulty near neighbor search problem that recently be introduce namely potential function relative contrast
