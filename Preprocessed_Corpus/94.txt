automatic gender classification system from finger ratio comparison successes with use different algorithm classification algorithm mass death automatic gender estimation index ring finger ratio high rate correctness information determine identity corps mass death such disaster aircraft highspeed train or sea accident fire where people damage an extent that they not identify method follow main element this study dataset be form by take index finger ring finger height age turkish men turkish woman dataset be use identify sex person thus information that could reveal identity information be obtain lad tree algorithm naive bayes algorithm knn algorithm algorithm be try datasets algorithm high rate success determine sex with rate therefore automatic sex classification be make use algorithm study reveal that ratio varies different sex race move from these study sex be determine from ratio index finger ring finger when compare with exist study literature different race it be prove that race also determine it be find that left hand provide high success finger ratio use identify sex compare right hand
