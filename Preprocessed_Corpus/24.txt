improve performance problem with few label data by reuse stacked autoencoders transfer learn deep learn artificial neural network deep architecture be use transfer learn application with aim improve performance network design give problem by reuse knowledge from another problem this work address transfer knowledge between deep network use classifier digit shape image consider case where only set class label or only data distribution change from source target problem our main goal be study how performance knowledge transfer between such problem would affect by vary number layer be retrained amount data use that retrain generally reuse network train different label set lead good result than reuse network train different data distribution particular reuse less class network train more class be beneficial virtually any amount training data case retrain only one layer save time consistently lead poor performance result obtain when retrain upright digit network train rotate digit raise hypothesis that transfer learning could use well deal with image classification problem which only small amount label data available training
