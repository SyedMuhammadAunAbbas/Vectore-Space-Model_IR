medical image classification via svm use lbp feature from saliencybased fold data image classificationsaliencyfoldinglocal binary patternssupport vector machine good result image classification retrieval use support vector machine svm with local binary pattern lbps feature be extensively report literature where an entire image retrieve or classify contrast medical image not part image may equally significant or relevant image retrieval application hand instance lung xray image lung region may contain tumour hence be highly significant whereas surround area do not contain significant information from medical diagnosis perspective this paper propose detect salient region image during train fold data reduce effect irrelevant region result small image area will use lbp feature calculation consequently classification by svm use irma dataset with xray image verify performance propose approach result demonstrate benefit saliencybased fold approach that deliver comparable classification accuracy with stateoftheart but exhibit low computational cost storage requirement factor highly important big data analytics
