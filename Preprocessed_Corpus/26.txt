human action recognition base mocap information use convolution neural network convolutional neural network cnn motion capture mocap human action recognition an important component semantic analysis human behavior this paper propose an approach human action recognition base motion capture mocap information use convolutional neural network cnn distance base metric compute from mocap information only three human joint use computation feature range temporal variation these distance metric consider design feature which discriminative action recognition convolutional neural network capable recognize local pattern use identify human action from temporal variation these feature which distort due inconsistency execution action across observation subject experiment conduct berkeley mhad dataset demonstrate effectiveness propose approach
