multiview centroid base fuzzy classification large data classificationsoft clusteringmultiview data modern data increasingly complex high dimensionality heterogeneity independent multiple representation basic property todays data with increase source data collection single object multiple representation which call view this paper propose multiview classification technique which use fuzzy map obtain maximum similarity between an object near multiview centroid our fuzzy mapping base approach obtains unit hyperplane common space each view establish efficacy our propose method present experimental comparison with number baseline two synthetic two realworld data set
