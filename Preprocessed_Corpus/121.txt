effect dataset size training tweet sentiment classifier sentiment analysistweet miningclassificationbig data use automated method label tweet sentiment large volume tweet label used train classifier million tweet could use train classifier however do so computationally expensive thus it valuable establish how many tweet should utilize train classifier since use additional instance with gain performance waste resource this study seek find out how many tweet need before significant improvement observe sentiment analysis when add additional instance train evaluate classifier use decision tree naïve bayes near neighbor radial basis function network with seven datasets vary from instance model train use four run cross validation additionally conduct statistical test verify our observation examine impact limiting feature use frequency learner be find improve with dataset size with naïve bayes be best perform learner find that naïve bayes do not significantly benefit from use more than instance best our knowledge this first study investigate how learner scale respect dataset size with result verify use statistical test multiple model train each learner dataset size additionally investigate use feature frequency greatly reduce data grid size with either small increase or decrease classifier performance depend choice learner
