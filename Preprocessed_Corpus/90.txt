improve selection auxiliary objective use reinforcement learn nonstationary environment nonstationary objective selection multiobjectivization auxiliary objective earl reinforcement learning efficiency evolutionary algorithm increase by use auxiliary objective method which call earl consider this method reinforcement learn rl algorithm use select objective evolutionary algorithms ea during optimization earlier study reinforcement learn algorithms stationary environment be use earl method however if behavior auxiliary objective change during optimization process it good use reinforcement learn algorithm which specially develop nonstationary environment our previous work propose new reinforcement learn algorithm use earl method this work propose an improved version that algorithm new algorithm apply nonstationary problem compare with method which be use other study it show that propose method achieves optimal value more often obtain high value target objective than other algorithm
