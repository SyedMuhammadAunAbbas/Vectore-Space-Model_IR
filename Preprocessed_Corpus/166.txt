use machine learn understand mitigate model form uncertainty turbulence model machine learningturbulence modelingrule extraction question how accurately model turbulent flow one most longstanding open problem physic advance high performance compute enable direct numerical simulation increasingly complex flow nevertheless most flow engineering relevance computational cost these direct simulation prohibitive necessitate empirical model closure turbulent transport these empirical model prone model form uncertainty when their underlying assumption violate understand quantify mitigate this model form uncertainty become critical challenge turbulence model community this paper will discuss strategy use machine learn understand root cause model form error develop model correction mitigate this error rule extraction technique use derive simple rule when critical model assumption violate physical intuition gain from these simple rule then use construct linear correction term turbulence model which show improvement over naive linear fit
