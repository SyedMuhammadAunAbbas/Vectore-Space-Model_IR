adaptive modular approach online fault diagnosis discrete event system adaptive approachesfault diagnosisdiscrete event systemsdiagnosabiliy this paper an adaptive modular approach propose achieve fault diagnosis discrete event system desire normal behavior represent by set specification while fault each predefined fault type consider execution specific fault behavior violate specification inference fault type each fault achieve by diagnosis module call diagnoser this approach consider that only normal behavior know advance then it adapt diagnoser order integrate new specific fault behavior into it inference engine this adaptation allow increase diagnosis capacity call diagnosability over time
