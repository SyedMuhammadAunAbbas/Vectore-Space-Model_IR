learn convex piecewise linear machine datadriven optimal control learn convex functiondatadrivenoptimal controlpiecewise linear datadriven optimal control op scheme one or more involved component such objective function system dynamic or operation constraint describe with statistical model learn from data this work focus machine learn operation constraint which rarely address previous research although rich collection supervise learn method exist literature most them not suitable model operation constraint because their decision rule usually induce undesirable nonlinear coupling system variable order surpass simple linear model while same time maintain compatibility with downstream control application propose describe system operation requirement by convex piecewise linear machine cplm which do not incur any difficulty optimization directly pluggable generalization performance propose classifier analyze through bound it vcdimension large margin cost sensitive learn objective formulate with bayes consistent hinge loss solve train problem by online stochastic gradient descent propose mixed integer base initialization method case study heat ventilation air condition hvac system control with comfort requirement conduct result show that cplm not only promise candidate cost sensitive learn general but also enable much good description exploitation system operation region optimal control purpose
