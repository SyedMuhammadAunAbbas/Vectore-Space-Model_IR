deep learn base car damage classification automobilestrainingfeature extractionmachine learningsupport vector machinesglass image base vehicle insurance process an important area with large scope automation this paper consider problem car damage classification where some category finegranular explore deep learning base technique this purpose initially try directly train cnn however due small set label data it do not work well then explore effect domainspecific pretraining follow by finetuning finally experiment with transfer learn ensemble learn experimental result show that transfer learning work well than domain specific finetuning achieve accuracy with combination transfer ensemble learning
