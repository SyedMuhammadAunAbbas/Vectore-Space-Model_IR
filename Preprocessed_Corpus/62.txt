budget learn develop personalized treatment reinforcement learn budget learn bayesian active learn personalized treatment there increase interest use patientspecific information personalize treatment personalize treatment decision rule learn use data from standard clinical trial but such trial very costly run this paper explore use budget learn technique design more efficient clinical trial by effectively determine which type patient recruit each time throughout duration trial propose bayesian bandit model discuss computational challenge issue pertain this approach compare our budget learning algorithm which approximately minimize bayes risk use both simulate data data model after clinical trial treat depressed individual with other plausible algorithm show that our budget learning algorithm demonstrate excellent performance across wide variety situation
