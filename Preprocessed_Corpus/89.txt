intelligent crude oil price forecaster gaussian process ensemble learn online learn crude oil price forecasting linear regression support vector machine decision tree propose two ensemble regression algorithm forecast daily price crude oil from feature extract from u energy administration some international news agency an ensemble regression model consist group homogeneous regressors with vary parameter eg linear regression model with different ridge regularization parameter first ensemble method call recent leader pick individual regressor with least mean square error over recent data second model call exponentially weight ensemble combine individual regressors linear fashion with weight constituent model decay exponentially with mean square error over past prediction these two method be test with linear regression support vector regression decision tree gaussian process exponentially weight ensemble with support vector regression best performance
