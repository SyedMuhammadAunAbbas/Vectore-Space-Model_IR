integrate active learning with supervision crowdsourcing generalization crowdsourcingactive learningsupervised classification with various online crowdsourcing platform it easy collect multiple label same example from crowd consensus integration algorithm infer estimate ground truth from multiple label set these crowdsourcing datasets however it couldnt avoid that these integrate estimate label still contain noise order far improve performance model learn from data with these integrate label propose an active learning framework far improve data quality such that improve model quality through acquire limited true label from expert oracle further investigate two active learn strategy term two uncertainty measure ie clue mue within active learn framework from our experimental result eight simulation crowdsourcing datasets four realworld crowdsourcing datasets with three popular consensus integration algorithm draw several conclusion follow i our active learning framework with input from oracle significantly improve generalization ability model learn from crowdsourcing data ii our two active learn strategy outperform random active learning strategy
