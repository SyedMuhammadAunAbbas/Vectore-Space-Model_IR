new approach segment hemorrhagic stroke compute tomography via optimum path snake active contour methodoptimum path forestsnakesimage segmentation this work present new approach segment hemorrhagic stroke base an active contour method call optimum path snake ops analysis human tissue density ahtd be introduce evolution pulmonary density analysis feature extractor result this approach be compare with region grow watershed level set base coherent propagation method segment stroke region accuracy matthews correlation coefficient dice coefficient hausdorff distance harmonic mean metric be use verify efficacy ops over other method ops method along with ahtd extractor present best result which demonstrate potential this approach use medical diagnosis system
