multivariable neural network forecast use two stage feature selection forecast feature selection neural network this paper propose novel neural network base forecaster that predict more than one variable time two stage neural network training algorithm use that employ newton algorithm estimate vector hidden unit optimal learning factor each iteration order reduce size neural network train it more effectively forecaster us both subsetting transformation type feature selection reduce number neural net input by
