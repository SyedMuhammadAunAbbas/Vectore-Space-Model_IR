add diversity rank example anytime near neighbor classification anytime algorithm near neighbor classification data stream data streams ubiquitous virtually every application domain however property that common various domain frequently disregard very high fluctuating data rate which event not occur with fixed frequency classical learn algorithm not seem adequate such scenario contrast anytime classification provide very convenient approach this situation summary an anytime classifier interrupt any time before it completion still able provide an intermediate classification popular knearest neighbor classifier easily make anytime by introduce rank training example this paper show how current stateoftheart knn anytime classifier make more accurate by introduce diversity training set rank our result show that with this simple modification performance anytime version knn algorithm consistently improve large number datasets
