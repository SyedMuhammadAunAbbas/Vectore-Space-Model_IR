compare gaussian mixture model hidden markov model classify unique physical activity from accelerometer sensor data accelerometerwaveletpcagmmhmmconfusion matrix with recent interest physical therapy through sufficient physical activity considerable effort be make monitor classify daily human activity especially people who need physical rehabilitation our previous study design classifier identify unique physical activity perform by healthy participant between age this study with use geneactiv accelerometer monitor wide range daily activity present learn approach identify unique activity perform by varied group participant with various health condition dataset comprise senior participant participant who significantly taller height than general population perform unique activity extract different feature time frequency domain select most efficient feature with sequential forward selection algorithm with two stage classification first utilized combine similar class second determines final decision test two classifier our learn approach gaussian mixture model gmms hidden markov model hmms compare their performance improve gmm classifier from our previous study it show more promising result this dataset achieve an accuracy when classify unique activity with gmm with hmm when classifying activity
