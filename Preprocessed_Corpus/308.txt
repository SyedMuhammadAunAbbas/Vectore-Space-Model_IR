study effect different control period neural network base reference modify pid control dcdc converter neural networkdcdc convertercontrol period computational burden this paper study about computational burden reference modify pid with neural network prediction dcdc converter flexible control method require realize superior transient response since converter nonlinear behavior however computational burden become problem implement control computation device this paper neural network adopt improve transient response output voltage dcdc converter under consideration it computational burden neural network computation part long computation period than pid main control part it possible since neural network give more than one prediction which require reference modification each main control period therefore reference modification adopt every main control period from result it confirm that propose method improve transient response effectively with reduce computational burden neural network control
