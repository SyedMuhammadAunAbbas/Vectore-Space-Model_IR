hierarchical metaclassifier human activity recognition accelerometerslegged locomotionfeature extractionmonitoringdata miningactivity recognitiondecision tree this paper propose multilevel metaclassifier identify human activity base accelerometer data train data consist subject perform combination different activity monitor use single hipworn triaxial accelerometer time frequency base feature be extract from twosecond window raw accelerometer data subset feature together with demographic information be select classification activity be divide into five activity group nonambulatory activity walk run climb upstairs climb downstairs multiple classification technique be test each classifier level group random forest be find perform comparatively well each level base upon those test hierarchical classifier consist random forest classifier be build first level nonambulatory activity separate from rest second ambulatory activity divide into four activity group final level activity classify individually accuracy test set be find approximately overall individual activity activity group level these result compare favorably contemporary result classify human activity
