bayesian network inverse inference manufacturing bayesian network inverseinferencemanufacturingbayesiannetworks physic base simulation manufacture process use prediction material property defect number industrial application however practise engineer often require solution an inverse problem prediction input desire outcome inverse problem usually solve by constrained optimisation extensive simulation during optimisation avoid through response surface construct from simulation but design space often so large that even with response surface optimisation might not possible moreover these problem typically illposed so discriminative model such artificial neural network not work well this paper investigate application conditional linear gaussian bayesian network address inverse problem with multipass wire draw process case study propose an approach systematically find solution rank them accord their likelihood
