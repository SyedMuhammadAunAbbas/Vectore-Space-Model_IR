online learn algorithm collective lda topic modelonline learningvariational inferencemulticorporadata mining collective latent dirichlet allocation clda propose an extension lda simultaneously model multiple corpus from different domain order overcome bias individual corpus however with large volume document collection from various source it become challenge achieve fast convergence clda high time complexity clda limit it application realworld task luckily online learn show promise speed convergence lda this paper propose explore online learn collective lda ovclda first develop an efficient variational inference algorithm collective lda then extend it online learn framework perform experiment with various realworld corpus experimental result show that ovclda learn comparable topic with clda well than online lda achieves comparable computational efficiency with online lda much more efficient than clda
