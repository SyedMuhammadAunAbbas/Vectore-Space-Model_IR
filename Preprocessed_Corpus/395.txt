limitation convolutional neural network recognize negative image convolutional neural networksnegative image convolutional neural network cnns achieve stateoftheart performance variety computer vision task particularly visual classification problem where new algorithm report achieve or even surpass human performance this paper examine whether cnns capable learn semantics train data this end evaluate cnns negative image since they share same structure semantics regular image human classify them correctly our experimental result indicate that when train regular image test negative image model accuracy significantly low than when it test regular image this lead u conjecture that current training method not effectively train model generalize concept then introduce notion semantic adversarial example transform input that semantically represent same object but model do not classify them correctly present negative image one class such input
