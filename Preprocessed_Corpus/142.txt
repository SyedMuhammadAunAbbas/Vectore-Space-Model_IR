transfer learn air combat behavior reinforcement learningtransfer learningair combattraining simulationscomputer generate force machine learn technique help automatically generate behavior computer generate force inhabit air combat training simulation however complexity scenario increase so do time learn optimal behavior transfer learn potential significantly shorten learn time between domain that sufficiently similar this paper transfer air combat agent with experience fight scenario various scenario performance transfer agent compare that agent that learn from scratch scenario experiment show that experience gain scenario very beneficial plain scenario where far learn minimal difficult scenario transfer also occur far learn ensues result pave way fast generation behavior rule air combat agent new complex scenario use exist behavior model
