iteratively learn liver segmentation use probabilistic atlas preliminary result liver segmentationprobabilistic atlasviscous reconstruction this work deal with concept liver segmentation by use priori information base probabilistic atlas segmentation learn base previous step probabilistic atlas here understood probability or membership map that tell how likely that point belongs shape draw from shape distribution hand devise procedure segment perfusion magnetic resonance liver image that combine both probabilistic atlas liver segmentation algorithm base global information previous simpler segmentation step local information from close segment slice finally mathematical morphology procedure namely viscous reconstruction fill shape preliminary result algorithm provide
