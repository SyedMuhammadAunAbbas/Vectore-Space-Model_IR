deep learning microalgae classification microalgae classificationimbalanced classesdeep learningconvolutional neural networksdata augmentation microalgae unicellular organism that present limit physical characteristic such size shape or even present structure classify them manually may require great effort from expert since thousand microalgae find small sample water furthermore manual classification nontrivial operation propose deep learning technique solve problem also create classified dataset that allow u adopt this technique best our knowledge present work first one apply this kind technique microalgae classification task obtain result show capability method properly classify data by use input low resolution image acquire by particle analyzer instead preprocessed feature also show improvement provide by use data augmentation technique
