tool machine with brain touchless wheel alignment with neural network train with noisy data wheel alignment distance measure neural network kohonen self organize network association map this document describe proof concept new approach next generation wheel alignment system propose measure relevant angel with kohonen self organize network from an image heavy precision camera instead project system clamp wheel this clear advantage that not need attach specially design clamp which hold wheel with mirror scale or led that target system will shoot photo from each wheel from well determine position calculate relevant angel from it with kohonen self organize neural network compare utility several distance measure retrieve best association map which determine necessary coordinate system design learn system that need certain amount training training design that it surely converge after well determined number run further optimize train use noisy data system design car manufacturer that need measure many similar car daily basis
