home appliance energy disaggregation use low frequency data machine learn classifier smart energysmart housingdisaggregationnon intrusive load monitoringneural networkfeature selection home appliance monitoring provide useful information about appliance usage which use well inform user about their consumption habit promote energy conservation however meter load cost prohibitive instead many tried disaggregate load from aggregate power measurement exist approach that require submetering high resolution power signal individual appliance during train test impractical economically infeasible this paper introduce lowcost approach home appliance monitoring base observation make single circuit our approach consist three step first apply neural network classifier segment input power signal then apply another classifier label each segment an individual appliance or multiple appliance finally iteratively disaggregate multiappliance segment with classifier previous step our propose approach evaluate two experiment first experiment us fully label public dataset consist segment from student bedroom university campus second experiment us segment from redd public dataset evaluation show that our approach accurately detect those appliance that dominate energy consumption overall accuracy respectively also present an indepth analysis failure conjecture why they harder detect
