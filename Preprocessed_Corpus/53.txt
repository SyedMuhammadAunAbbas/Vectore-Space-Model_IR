improve robustness gaussian processbased inferential control system use kernel principle component analysis control system process control kernel gaussian process principal component analysis robustness vector plausibility robustness an inferential control system entirely depend prediction accuracy estimator use feedback element this paper base previously propose gaussian process inferential controller that employ gaussian process soft sensor an estimator paper enhance robustness reliability control system particularly during sensor input failure contribution paper i alleviate affect failure prediction accuracy feedback element soft sensor thus improve robustness overall control system ii hybridise kernel principal component analysis with gaussian process inferential control system achieve this robustness during process operate condition paper empirically show effectiveness plausibility process hybrid system simulate chemical reactor process
