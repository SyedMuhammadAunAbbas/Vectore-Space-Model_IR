expose inpainting forgery jpeg image under recompression attack inpaintingcombination forgeryjpegrecompressionimage forgery detection inpainting originally design computer vision reconstruct lose or deteriorate part image videos be use image tamper include region fill object removal alter truth while several type tamper include copymove seam carve forgery now successfully expose image forensics there be very little study tackle inpainting forgery jpeg image detection which extremely challenge due postrecompression attack perform cover or compromise original inpainting trace date there effective way detect inpainting image forgery under combine recompression attack fill such gap image forensics reveal inpainting forgery from postrecompression attack jpeg image propose this paper an approach that begin with large feature mining discrete transform domain ensemble learn then apply deal with high feature dimensionality prevent overfitting that generally happen some regular classifier under high feature dimension our study show propose approach effectively expose inpainting forgery under post recompression attack especially it noticeably improve detection accuracy while recompression quality low than original jpeg image quality thus bridge gap image forgery detection
