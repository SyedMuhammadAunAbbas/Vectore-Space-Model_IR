car follow markov regime classification calibration car follow modelregime classificationmodel calibrationdriver behaviormarkov switch model car follow behavior recently gain much attention due it wide variety application this include accident analysis driver assessment support system road design this paper present model that leverage markov regime switch model classify various car follow regimes detect car follow regime then mine calibrate parameter driver dependent driver current drive regime two stage markov regime switch model utilized detect different car follow regime first stage discriminate normal car follow regime from abnormal one while second stage classifies normal car follow regime their finegrained regime like brake accelerate stand freeflowing normal following genetic algorithm then employ observe driver data each car follow regime optimize car follow model parameter value driver each regime experimental evaluation propose model use real dataset show that it detect upnormal rare short time event addition it infer switch process dynamic such expect duration probability move from one regime another switch parameter each regime finally model able accurately calibrate parameter driver accord their driving regime so achieve well understand driver behavior good simulation drive situation
