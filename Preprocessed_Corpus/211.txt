efficient rotation invariant fingerprint match algorithm use adjustment factor minutiaebifurcationridgeafisfingerprintminutia code this paper present new efficient rotation invariant algorithm that make use local feature forfingerprint match minutia point first extract from afingerprint image minutia code mc define this paper then generate each extracted minutia point propose minutia code invariant rotation fingerprint image adjustment factor af introduce address problem due difference claimant fingerprint template fingerprint same person that may present due variation ink or variation pressure apply between finger scanner adjustment factor calculate from minutia code mc two fingerprint be match two stage fingerprint match process propose during first stage only few minutia code check decide if second stage match process require this make match process faster propose strategy test number publicly available image database result promise
