wifi localization mobile robot base random forest gplvm wifi slam mobile robot random forest gplvm khepera proliferation wifi network attract many research community employ wifi signal estimate location mobile device indoor environmentsin this paper propose localization framework that capable determine location mobile robot indoor limited area propose framework exploit random forest algorithm both classification regression technique which use build cooperate supervised localization model localization model train offline base training data that contain measurement wifi signal strength location these measurement also propose an extension our framework use gaussian process latent variable model gplvm which give our framework ability build subjective localization model which dont require any prior knowledge about ground truth localization place our experimental evaluation propose framework use kheperaiii mobile robot one testbed show that it give high accuracy where calculate mean localization error cm
