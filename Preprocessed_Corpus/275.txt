an lead base indoor localization system use kmeans cluster indoor localizationkmeansunsupervised learningclustering this paper introduce novel visible light position vlp system use an unsupervised machine learn approach two transmitter consist light emit diode led which modulate with khz khz sinusoidal signal respectively receiver end receive signal strength rss calculate sparse gridcube construct by measure light intensity different location bilinear interpolation then apply create dense grid reading which use train hierarchical kmeans cluster system give query leds reading train cluster use position estimation by minimize distance between reading cluster centroid experimental result show that an average accuracy achieve room with dimension far compare performance two other cluster method kmedoids fuzzy cmeans however significant improvement over kmeans cluster find
