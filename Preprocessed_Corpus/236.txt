an application classification class decomposition use case point estimation method effort predictionclassificationclustering use case point ucp estimation method describe process compute software project size productivity from use case diagram element these metric then use predict project effort early stage software development main challenge with previous model that they be construct base very limited number observation use limited productivity ratio this paper present new approach predict productivity from ucp environmental factor by apply classification with decomposition technique class decomposition provide number advantage supervise learn algorithm through segmenting class into more homogenous class therefore increase their diversity propose model construct validate over two datasets that relatively sufficient number observation accuracy result promise potential increase accuracy early effort estimation
