speaker adaptation use speaker similarity score dnn feature deep neural networksknearest neighborphoneme classificationfeature learningspeaker adaptation this paper propose novel speaker adaptation algorithm classify speech base deep neural network dnns adaptation algorithm consist two step first step deep neural network train use raw melfrequency cepstral coefficient mfcc feature discover hidden structure data employ activation last hidden layer dnn acoustic feature second step use near neighbor an adaptation algorithm learn speaker similarity score base small amount adaptation data from each target speaker use dnnbased acoustic feature base speaker similarity score classification do use knearest neighbor knn classifier novelty this work that instead modify retrain dnn speaker adaptation which comprise large number parameter computationally expensive activation learn dnn use project feature from mfcc sparse dnn space then speaker adaptation perform base similarity ie near neighbor use knn algorithm with only small amount adaptation data it reduce number phoneme classification error timit dataset by this work also analyze impact deep neural network architecture speaker adaptation performance
