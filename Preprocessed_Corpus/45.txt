genetically supervise selforganizing map classification glass sample classification selforganizing map genetic optimization supervision selforganizing map som useful tool create abstraction highdimensional distribution input it compute ideal map domain observation use either discrete or continuous distribution value som benefit from couple with genetic algorithm ga gas optimization algorithm that allow user evolve solution from distribution potential solution fit candidate survive participate production future generation new solution fusion these two technique result dynamic algorithm that map diverse input plane an optimizing fashion strive towards perfection while learn from mistake will detail general principle involve demonstrate performance this algorithm classification glass sample
