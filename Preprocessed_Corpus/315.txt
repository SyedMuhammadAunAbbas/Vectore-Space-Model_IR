web base pipeline tool combination logic condition ng data next generation sequence ngspipelinegenome analysis toolkit gatk development software tool analyze nextgeneration sequence ng data one urgent task bioinformatics field currently lot nextgeneration sequence data analysis software be develop however most them only support one type analysis such sequence alignment or function annotation by command line therefore friendly user interface ng data with few configuration necessary this paper web base automatic pipeline run high performance compute environment be introduce raw data be generate from illumine sequence instrument gatk base parallel commutate scheme use control generate result pipeline start from fastq file upload by graphical interface then data will analyze automatically
