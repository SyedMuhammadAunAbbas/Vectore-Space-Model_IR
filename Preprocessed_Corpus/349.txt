anomaly prediction base kmeans cluster memoryconstrained embedded device anomaly predictionkmeans clusteringonline kmeans cluster this paper propose an anomaly prediction method base kmeans cluster that assume embedded device with memory constraint predict control system anomalies with this method by check control system behavior it possible predict anomaly however continue cluster difficult because data accumulate memory similar exist kmeans cluster method which problematic embed device with low memory capacity therefore also propose kmeans cluster continue cluster infinite stream data propose kmeans cluster method base online kmeans cluster sequential processing propose kmeans cluster method only store data require anomaly prediction release other data from memory experimental result show that anomaly predict by kmeans cluster propose method predict anomaly similar standard kmeans cluster while reduce memory consumption moreover propose kmeans cluster demonstrates well result anomaly prediction than exist online kmeans cluster
