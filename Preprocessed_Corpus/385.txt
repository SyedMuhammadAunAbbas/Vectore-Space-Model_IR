integrate framework improve largescale hierarchical classification hierarchical classificationinconsistencylogistic regressionscalabilityorphan node prediction hierarchical classification hc approach leverage hierarchical structure during train test model which help improvement classification performance prediction efficiency however their performance improvement comparison flat approach may poor if hierarchy use training contains i inconsistent hierarchical relationship such parentchild or sibling ii less cohesive or overlap class moreover dynamic change data characteristic over time require new class orphan node identify improve generalization performance learn model addition also need deal with imbalance data largescale problem where large number class few example train pose statistical challenge this paper propose an integrate framework address aforementioned issue improve largescale hc our experimental evaluation various image text datasets show improved performance with our propose framework
