an analysis instance selection neural network improve train speed instance selection neural network train speed train artificial neural network ann relatively slow compare many other machine learn algorithm this study focus instance selection improve train speed first evaluate effectiveness instance selection algorithms knearest neighbor algorithm with ann then analyze factor accuracy distance from decision boundary dense region class distribution propose new instance selection algorithm discus tradeoff between accuracy train speed introduce measure tradeoff our empirical result real data set indicate that our propose rdi more effective with ann
