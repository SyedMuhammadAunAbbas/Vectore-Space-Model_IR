learn rank with only positive example information need model positive unlabeled learn transductive learn search by multiple example key successfully retrieve relevant document lie how user express their information need use keywords query however many user it difficult them use keywords express their information need searchbymultipleexamples sbme promise method overcome this problem allow user specify their information need set relevant document rather than set keywords this study propose transductive positive unlabeled learning tpu learn base framework document rank framework consist two step identify potential relevant document reduce search space from entire data collection small dataset adopt tpu learn method rerank search space by treat relevant document from user positive example p document search space unlabeled data u use map pk evaluate two stateoftheart pu learn algorithms rocchio classifier rc document rank propose framework with different size p simulate user online search behavior then adopt idea ensemble learning combine rc with two stateoftheart pu learn algorithm respectively experiment conduct two real datasets show that ensemble learn base method lead significant improvement performance
