neural network base kidney segmentation from mr image preliminary result kidney segmentationneural networksmr image automate robust kidney segmentation from medical image sequence very difficult task particularly because gray level similarity adjacent organ partial volume effect injection contrast medium addition these difficulty variation kidney shape position gray level make automate identification segmentation kidney harder also different image characteristic with different scanner much more increase difficulty segmentation task therefore this paper present an automated kidney segmentation method by use multilayer perceptron base approach that adapt parameter accord image handle these challenge problem efficiency term segmentation performance achieve by use information from previously segment kidney image propose approach also efficient term require processing time since it do not include preprocessing train stage which very time consume moreover unsupervised segmentation approach eliminate common problem most neural network base approach that dependency result choose data training stage
