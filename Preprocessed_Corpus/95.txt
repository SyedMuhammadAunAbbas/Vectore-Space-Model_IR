dynamic inclusion new event type visual inspection use evolve classifier expect change classifier accuracy visual inspection new event type integration new class onthefly evolve fuzzy classifier this paper deal with automatic inclusion new event type visual inspection system within context image classification recognize ok not ok part certain event directly associate with class event usually independent disjoint from each other this sense deal with problem integrate new class into image classifier onthefly specify online by an operator use evolve fuzzy classifier efc which rely fuzzy rule base able adapt their structure update their parameter incremental manner novel methodological aspect lie appropriate structural change efc whenever new class appear estimation expect change classifier accuracy old class see before which base an analysis expect change classifier decision boundary second point an important aspect operator they already familiar work with establish classifier that some accuracy classification new concept will evaluate realworld visual inspection scenario where main task classify event type which may occur microfluidic chip may lead deterioration their quality
