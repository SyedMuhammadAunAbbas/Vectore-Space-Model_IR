stack method hierarchical classification hierarchical classificationbioinformaticsstacking hierarchical classification hc consist classification problem whose class structure hierarchical fashion many problem address by hc special decent amount work deal with bioinformatics relate problem such protein function prediction pfp transposable element tes classification both them still challenge task hc due noisy imbalanced nature datasets countermeasure stack an ensemble method capable generalize knowledge from many classifier this work propose three stack method hc evaluate it performance pfp tes datasets our result show that when compare regular stack stateofart method from literature our method able obtain superior or competitive performance
