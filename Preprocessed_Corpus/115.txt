statistical fault localization base importance sample fault localizationimportance sample this paper present novel probabilistic approach fault localization challenge base importance sample iterative approach utilizes test result execution profile estimate likelihood suspiciousness program statement over few iteration probability update sample procedure direct it attention towards those statement that more likely faulty propose approach design more sensitive fail test case comparison pass test case effectiveness propose stochastic approach evaluate through two case study result compare against other popular fault localization method
