sequential logistic principal component analysis slpca dimensional reduction stream multivariate binarystate system energy enduse model dimensional reduction sequential optimization sequential or online dimensional reduction interest due explosion stream data base application requirement adaptive statistical model many emerge field such model energy enduse profile principal component analysis pca classical way dimensional reduction however traditional singular value decomposition svd base pca fail model data which largely deviate from gaussian distribution bregman divergence be recently introduce achieve generalize pca framework if random variable under dimensional reduction follow bernoulli distribution which occur many emerge field generalize pca call logistic pca lpca this paper extend batch lpca sequential version ie slpca base sequential convex optimization theory convergence property this algorithm discuss compare batch version lpca ie blpca well it performance reduce dimension multivariate binarystate system it application building energy enduse profile model also investigate
