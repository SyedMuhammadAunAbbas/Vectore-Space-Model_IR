android malware detection build useful representation malware classificationlogistic regressionrandom projectionandroiddimensionality reductionfeature selection problem proactively detect android malware proven challenge one challenge stem from variety issue but recent literature show that this task hard solve with high accuracy when only restrict set feature like permission or similar fix set feature use opposite approach include available feature also problematic it cause feature space grow beyond reasonable size this paper focus find an efficient way select representative feature space preserve it discriminative power unseen data go beyond traditional approach like principal component analysis which too heavy largescale problem with million feature particular show that many feature group that extract from android application package like feature extract from manifest file or string extract from dalvik executable dex should filter use classification separately our propose dimensionality reduction scheme apply each group separately consist raw string preprocessing feature selection via logodds finally apply random projection with size feature space grow exponentially function train set size our approach drastically decrease size feature space several order magnitude this turn allow accurate classification become possible real world scenario after reduce dimensionality use feature group lightweight ensemble logistic classifier evaluate proposed classification scheme real malware data provide by antivirus vendor achieve stateoftheart true positive reasonably low false positive rate with significantly compress feature space balance test set sample
