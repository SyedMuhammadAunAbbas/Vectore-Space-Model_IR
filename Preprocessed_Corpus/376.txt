lecture vdeo index use boosted margin maximize neural network video indexingimage matchingconvolutional neural networkboosting this paper present novel approach lecture video index use boosted deep convolutional neural network system index perform by match high quality slide image which text either know or extract low resolution video frame with possible noise perspective distortion occlusion propose deep neural network integrate with boost framework compose two subnetworks target feature extraction similarity determination perform matching trained network give input pair slide image candidate video frame image produce similarity between them boost framework integrate into our propose network during training process experimental result show that propose approach much more capable handle occlusion spatial transformation other type noise when compare with known approach
