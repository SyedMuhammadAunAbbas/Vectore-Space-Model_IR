hybrid scheme fault diagnosis with partially label set observation fault diagnosissemisupervised learningbearing defectsdimensionality reductioninduction motor machine learn technique widely use diagnose fault guarantee safe reliable operation system among various technique semisupervised learn help diagnose faulty state decision make partially label data where only few number label observation along with large number unlabeled observation collect from process thus it crucial conduct critical study use semisupervised technique both dimensionality reduction fault classification this work three stateofthe art semisupervised dimensionality reduction technique use produce informative feature semisupervised fault classifier this study aim achieve best pair semisupervised dimensionality reduction classification technique that integrate into diagnostic scheme decision make under partially label set observation
