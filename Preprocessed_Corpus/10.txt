detection abnormal human behavior use matrix approximationbased approach abnormal event detection lowrank approximation adaptive learning automatic detection abnormal event one central task video surveillance this paper present matrix approximationbased method detect abnormal human behavior our model behavior pattern represent by motion matrix obtain through object track model typical motion associate with normal behavior with set motion subspace compute through lowrank matrix approximation then abnormal human behavior identify by motion deviation from representative subspace our method do not require complicated classification procedure fast detect abnormal event complex scene addition through adaptive learning module our model build observe data expand by incorporate new behavior pattern during detection process result simulate surveillance video show effectiveness our method
