nmfbased label space factorization multilabel classification multilabel classificationnon negative matrix factorizationfeature aware multilabel classification learn task which each data sample belong more than one class until now some method that base reduce dimensionality label space be propose however these method not use specific property label space this purpose this paper intend find hidden space which both input feature vector label vector embed propose modify nonnegative matrix factorization nmf method that suitable decompose label matrix find proper hidden space by featureaware approach consider that label matrix binary also this matrix some deserving label an instance may not call miss label conduct several experiment show superiority our propose method stateoftheart multi label classification method
