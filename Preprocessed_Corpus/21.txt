human action recognition base recognition linear pattern action bank feature use convolutional neural network human action recognition action bank feature deep convolutional network this paper propose deep convolutional network architecture recognize human action videos use action bank feature action bank feature compute against predefined set video know an action bank contain linear pattern represent similarity video against action bank video due independence pattern across action bank feature convolutional neural network with linear mask consider capture local pattern associate with each action knowledge gain through training use assign an action label video during test experiment conduct dataset demonstrate effectiveness propose approach capture recognize these linear local pattern
