finegrained opinion extraction with markov logic network opinion extractionmarkov logic networksjoint inference markov logic network joint inference framework that combine logical probabilistic representation enable effective modeling dependency that exist between different instance data sample while it ability capture relational dependency make it an ideal framework predict structure inherent many natural language processing nlp task it arguably underused nlp especially comparison other joint inference framework such integer linear programming this paper present first markov logic model nlp task finegrained opinion extraction that exploit factuality lexicon when evaluate standard evaluation corpus our approach surpass stateoftheart approach performance
