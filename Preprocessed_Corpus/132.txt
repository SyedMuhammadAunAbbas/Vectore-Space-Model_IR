scalable learn entity predicate embeddings knowledge graph completion representation learningsemantic weblink predictionknowledge graph knowledge graph kg widely use formalism represent knowledge web data focus problem link prediction ie predict miss link large knowledge graph so discover new fact about world representation learn model that embed entity relation type continuous vector space recently be use achieve new stateoftheart link prediction result limit factor these model that process learn optimal embed vector really timeconsuming might even require day computation large kgs this work propose principled method sensibly reduce learn time while converge more accurate link prediction model furthermore employ propose method train evaluate set novel scalable model our extensive evaluation show significant improvement over stateoftheart link prediction method several datasets
