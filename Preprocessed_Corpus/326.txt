novel algorithm dynamic clustering property performance dynamic clusteringdata miningonline learningmultidensity clustering this paper present dynamic cluster algorithm that efficiently deal with data stream achieve several important property which not generally find together same algorithm dynamic cluster algorithm operate online two different timescale stage fast distancebased stage that generate microclusters densitybased stage that group microclusters accord their density generate final cluster algorithm achieves novelty detection concept drift thanks forget function that allow microclusters final cluster appear drift merge split or disappear this algorithm be design able detect complex pattern even multidensity distribution make assumption cluster convexity performance dynamic cluster algorithm assess theoretically through complexity analysis empirically through set experiment
