time warp symbolic aggregation approximation with bagofpatterns representation time series classification time series analysis correlation standard error analysis vector electrocardiography train standard symbolic aggregation approximation sax core many effective time series data mining algorithms it combination with bagofpatterns become standard approach with bleedingedge performance standard datasets however standard sax with bop representation might neglect internal temporal correlation embed data this paper propose time warp sax which extend standard sax method with time delay embed vector approach by consider temporal correlation test time warp sax with bop representation benchmark dataset from ucr time series classificationclustering page them time warp sax overtakes stateoftheart performance standard sax validate our method real world application new dataset vital sign collect from patient who may require blood transfusion prbc next hour test result demonstrate that by consider temporal internal correlation our time warp sax with bop representation could significantly enhance representation power
