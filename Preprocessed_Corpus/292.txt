systemlevel test case prioritization use machine learn systemlevel testingblackbox testingtest case prioritizationsupervised machine learn regression test common task retesting software that be change or extend eg by new feature during software evolution retesting whole program not feasible with reasonable time cost usually only subset test case execute regression test eg by execute test case accord test case prioritization although vast amount method test case prioritization exist they mostly require access source code ie whitebox however industrial practice systemlevel test an important task that usually grant access source code ie blackbox hence an effective regression test process other information employ this paper introduce novel technique test case prioritization manual systemlevel regression test base supervised machine learn our approach considers blackbox metadata such test case history well natural language test case description prioritization use machine learn algorithm svm rank evaluate our approach by mean two subject system measure prioritization quality our result imply that our technique improve failure detection rate significantly compare random order addition able outperform test case order give by test expert moreover use natural language description improve failure find rate
