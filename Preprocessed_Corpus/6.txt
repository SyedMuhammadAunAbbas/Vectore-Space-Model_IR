high precision screen android malware with dimensionality reduction dimensionality reduction mobile security android principal component analysis this work present new method classify previously unseen android application malware or benign algorithm start with large set feature frequencies possible nbyte sequence application byte code principal component analysis apply that frequency matrix order reduce it lowdimensional representation which then feed into any several classification algorithm utilize implicitly restart lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm exploit sparsity ngram frequency matrix order efficiently compute lowdimensional representation when train upon that lowdimensional representation several classification algorithm achieve high accuracy than previous work
