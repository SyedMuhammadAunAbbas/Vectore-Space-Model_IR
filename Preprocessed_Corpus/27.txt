improve name entity recognition morphologically rich language use word embeddings czech ner name entity recognition word embeddings skipgram turkish ner this paper address name entity recognition ner problem morphologically rich language by employ semisupervised learn approach base neural network adopt fast unsupervised method learn continuous vector representation word use these representation along with language independent feature develop ner system evaluate our system highly inflectional turkish czech language obtain well fscore performance than previously publish result these language improve stateoftheart fscore by turkish czech unlike previous stateoftheart system develop these language our system do not make use any language dependent feature therefore believe it easily apply other morphologically rich language
